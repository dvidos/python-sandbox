# what are decisions?

what is a decision? let's try examples:

* we shall go  / we shall not go  (answer is yes/no to going)
* I will take umbrella  (answer is yes/no to umbrella-taking)
* The carton can be stored in aisles 5-7   (answer is 5-7 to storage-aisle)
* The person should work on X item   (answer is X to what-to-work-next)

Usually decisions also have explanations

* because the risk is low enough and reward is high enough
* because it's too dangerous
* because it is raining
* because it's fragile, and we are in prioritize tidyness working mode
* because it is needed to unblock the work of Y

so, a decision can be an association of two things,
for example X blocks Y, or storage-levels-allowed is 1 and 2
it can be an association of two groups of things.

As a human, we can ask "what will unblock Y?"
which could be rephrased as "what's causing Y to be blocked?"
or "What conditions could lead to Y being unblocked?".
So we know how to work both forwards and backwards in our logic deduction.

Maybe another way to see it is, logical definitions of tags.
e.g. the max of two numbers is x, if x >y else it's y.
Or, a line segment is vertical only if x1=x2.

Or relationships between people, like:
- grandparent is the parent of a parent
- brother is the son of the parent of a son that is not self
- mary is the parent of john
- a definition can also have a predicate, a condition.


## conclusions

A decision can be:

* a boolean value: raining is yes, we are not going
* a value: storage aisle number range is (5..7)
* an association: X blocks Y

The association my be workable forwards and backwards
